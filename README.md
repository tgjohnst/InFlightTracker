# InFlightTracker
Track your flight while connected to inflight wifi!

This project attempts to query standard GoGo inflight wifi endpoints and display the data prettily without having to use the GoGo app/dashboard. This is useful for those who want to track their flight without having to go through ad-ridden webpages and/or download the GoGo app.
